# Project Title

## Overview

This project is a production-level data engineering solution designed to process and transform large volumes of data. It focuses on extracting data from AWS S3 buckets, validating the data locally, and loading it into a data mart or SQL database.

## Features

* **Data Extraction from AWS S3:** Utilizes the AWS SDK (Boto3) to interact with S3 buckets.
* **Local Data Validation:** Ensures data quality and integrity before loading.
* **Data Transformation:** Processes and transforms data as needed for the target data mart or SQL database.
* **Data Loading:** Loads validated data into a data mart or SQL database.
* **Data Mart Storage:** Uses Parquet format with Snappy compression for efficient storage.
* **SQL Database Integration:** Supports loading data into SQL databases with a star schema (fact and dimension tables).
* **Logging:** Comprehensive logging to track project execution and potential issues.
* **Modular Design:** Well-structured codebase with modules for different functionalities.
* **Encryption:** Implements encryption for secure data handling.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Primary programming language.
* **Apache Spark:** Distributed data processing engine.
* **AWS S3:** Cloud storage for data.
* **AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):** Interaction with AWS services.
* **SQL:** Relational database interactions.
* **Parquet:** Columnar data storage format.
* **Snappy:** Data compression codec.
* **PyCharm:** Recommended IDE.
* **MySQL:** Database system (installation required).
